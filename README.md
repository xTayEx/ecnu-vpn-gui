# Introduction
In ECNU (East China Normal University), `openconnect` is used for connecting to intranet applications. However, there is only cli version of `openconnect`. For ease of use, I create a simple gui wrapper of `openconnect` to connect to ECNU's vpn.

# Prerequisite

* Qt5;
* qmake;
* QtDesigner;
* gcc 13.1.1 (lower versions may work, but have not been tested);
* Only supported for linux;
* And...an ECNU vpn account.
